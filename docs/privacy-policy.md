*Last updated 2021/12/22*

This document describes the privacy policy you agree to and accept by either i) Adding any of the bots listed below or ii) Being a member of any server using any of the bots listed below

## **This privacy policy applies to the following bots:**

Bulbbot#1439 `(868821693571932191)`

Bulbbot Status#0811 `(791051082892574750)`

Mod Mail#9192 `(791331386379993088)`

## Data Security and Storage

All of the data we store is encrypted and secure. The database is also password protected. Though reasonable steps have been taken to secure the user data, we **cannot** guarantee 100% security.

## Automatically Collected Data

*Automatically collected data is defined as information that is stored when the bot joins a new server or a user uses the bot.*

- Server ID of the server that the bot joined
- Server name of the server that the bot joined
- Bulbbot will store all message data (content, embeds, stickers and attachments) from the events it receives (meaning that the bot will need the read messages permsission in that channel to see those messages). This data is deleted after 30 days or if the server owner purges this data.

## Explicitly Collected Data

*Explicitly collected data is defined as information that is stored whenever a user invokes a command or modifies a configuration.*

- If a command is enabled or not
- If a command has a different clearance
- Blacklisted/whitelisted words/invites
- Punishment related to each automod action
- Role ID, if the server has auto roles/mutes setup
- Channel IDs if the server have logging setup
- When an infraction is created / when a tempban is created / when a tempmute is created
- Moderator ID
- Moderator tag (username + discriminator)
- Target ID
- Target tag (username + discriminator)
- Reason for the infraction

Bulbbot#1439 `(868821693571932191)` also utilizes Sentry for error handling and tracking, see their privacy policy over here [https://sentry.io/privacy/](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

## The purpose for storing this data

Our bot tries to store as little information as possible but needs to store some data for the bot to provide basic functionality. Our bot enables each server to customize the bot to suit their server environment and setup. The server ID is stored as the main key to each server, making it possible for us to bind all of the rest of the data we store and be able to uniquely identify each config on each command/event execution We store the infraction data to make it easier for mods to more easily distinguish which users have infractions and have not. We also store the full user tag of both mods and targets to remove an extra API call to fetch the user tags.
