## How to translate
Translating singular words is easy, just translate the word in the box. It's as simple as that!
![Translating_Screen_Word](../assets/Community/Translating_Screen_Word.png)

If the word has the green `{{variable}}` placeholders, **don't** translate them, but do include them. Like shown in the example below.

Don't forget to save before moving on the on the next word.


## Error Messages
If you forgot to include a variable in a translated string this box will show up. Please include the variable in the string and the error will be resolved.
