### 2. Configuring logging

Bulbbot comes with powerful logging features that allow you to log any actions in your server, from your Moderators taking actions on misbehavior, to role and channel updates, to even violations detected using Bulbbot's AutoMod. You can configure logging channels using the `/configure` command.

**Available logging types:** `mod_logs`, `automod`, `banpool_logs`*, `message_logs`, `role_logs`, `member_logs`, `channel_logs`, `thread_logs`, `invite_logs`, `join_leave`, `other` and `all`
